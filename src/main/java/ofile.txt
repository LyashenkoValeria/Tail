I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down
Life's too short to even care at all oh
I'm losing my mind losing my mind losing control
If I could find a way to see this straight, I'd run away
To some fortune that I, I should have found by now
And so I run to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down
One more spoon of cough syrup now whoa
One more spoon of cough syrup now whoa
